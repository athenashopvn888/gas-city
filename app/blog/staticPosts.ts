## Why Local Context Helps

GAS CITY CANNABIS is tied to O'Connor Dr and East York context in Toronto. Useful local content should make the page easier for shoppers to understand by connecting the store to nearby streets, neighbourhood language, and visit-planning details already supported by the site.

Menu category labels help adults 19+ move quickly from general store research to the product areas they care about. Use them to compare the sections already shown on the site, such as flower, pre-rolls, vapes, edibles, concentrates, accessories, or other store categories.

That makes the page easier to scan and gives shoppers a cleaner path from local research to the right store page.

## Adult 19+ Visit Basics

Adults 19+ should bring valid government identification, confirm the store page before leaving, and use the menu/category links to narrow down what they want to ask about in-store.
